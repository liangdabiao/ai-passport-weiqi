# Subsetting a CJK font for LVGL

Recorded while building the [Qiaopi Quiz app](weiqi-quest/README.md), an offline
fill-in-the-blank game for the FoloToy AI Passport. Everything below applies to any
application on this board that has to render Chinese; every number was measured on
an ESP32-C3 with 8 MB of flash and no PSRAM.

## Derive the inventory from the sources, never maintain it by hand

The app shows 91 questions with explanations and provenance lines, plus its own
interface strings, and that already needs **1270 distinct code points**. Nobody is
going to keep a list like that correct by hand, so `gen_font.py` derives it from
three places:

1. every character of the question bank, through the same `content.py` module the
   C table generator uses;
2. every non-ASCII character inside a string literal of `main/*.c|*.h`, after
   comments are stripped — Chinese comments therefore cost no flash;
3. printable ASCII plus the punctuation the interface draws itself.

The result is written to `assets/fonts/charset.txt` so a reviewer has something to
diff and so that "why is this glyph in here" has an answer:

```
# total code points: 1270  (CJK 1158, other 112)

# --- CJK ideographs ---
<1158 ideographs, in one unbroken run, no separators>

# --- everything else (ASCII, CJK punctuation, the fullwidth low line) ---
 !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABC...·—…、。《》「」！（），：；？＿
```

The first character of the second group is the space, which is easy to lose: a
trim step in the generator that strips whitespace would drop `U+0020` and the
inventory would silently become 1269 while still rendering correctly until the day
a string needs a space.

The ideographs are kept as a single unbroken run on purpose: a separator between
them would itself be picked up by the converter as a glyph to include.

The last character of the second group is a fullwidth low line, used to draw the
blank the reader has to fill. It is in the inventory because it appears in a
string literal of `qpq_content.c`, not because it was listed anywhere by hand.

## Verify every code point before converting

The master font here is Noto Sans CJK SC Regular, under the SIL Open Font License
1.1. Before conversion, every code point is looked up in the font's `cmap` with
`fontTools`, and a miss aborts the run with up to forty offending characters
printed. On this project the check reported 1270/1270 present.

This matters because the source text changes. A new question's explanation may
quote a rare variant character, and handing a font a code point it does not have
does **not** reliably stop the converter — it may happily emit a subset that is
missing that glyph, and you find out on the device, in the middle of a line, as a
blank box. Checking in advance converts that into a build error. It costs one pass
over the character map, which is cheap insurance.

## Three sizes, uncompressed, and why the large format is required

Sizes are 16 px (top bar, provenance, summary labels), 24 px (sentence, options,
explanation, full passage) and 32 px (title page headline and result rank), all at
4 bits per pixel and uncompressed, so they can be read straight out of the flash
mapping without decompression.

In LVGL's default text format the per-glyph bitmap offset is a 16-bit field, and
the 32 px subset's bitmap data exceeds 64 KB. `CONFIG_LV_FONT_FMT_TXT_LARGE=y` in
`sdkconfig.defaults` is therefore mandatory, not a tuning knob.

## The size of the generated `.c` file is not the flash cost

This one cost an hour of unnecessary alarm. The three generated files are 0.99 MB,
1.97 MB and 3.23 MB of source, which looks impossible next to a 7.94 MB partition.
It is not: each byte is written as `0xXX,`, six characters per byte of data.

The honest number comes from the link step: in
`build/firmware/<image sha>/FoloToy-AI-Passport.map`, the `glyph_bitmap` sections of
the three faces are 141,775, 313,755 and 536,595 bytes, or **about 0.95 MB for all
three**. The source files can be arbitrarily large; what matters is what the
compiler keeps. (Counting `glyph_dsc` and the kerning tables in the same map gives
165 KB, 333 KB and 550 KB.)

The practical rule: estimate flash by counting bytes, not by reading the generated
text. If you must guess before building, `glyphs × size × size ÷ 2` bytes per face
(for 4 bpp) is the right shape of estimate, and the real answer comes from the
firmware size report.

## A stale font is the easiest mistake to miss

Changing an interface string and forgetting to re-run the font generator is not
something a gate catches on its own — not until someone flashes the firmware, or
worse, a community reviewer rejects it. That is exactly what happened here: a
real-device fix added "scroll up and down" to the answer page's bottom bar, the
font was never regenerated, the two code points `U+7FFB` and `U+9605` had no
glyph, and the bar rendered as two boxes in the middle of a sentence.

The `--check` mode at the time did two things: it compared `charset.txt` against
the current derivation, and it verified the code points exist in the master font.
It did both, and both failed — but it **only printed a line to stderr and still
returned 0**, so the firmware build that ran right after it went through. Afterwards
every on-screen string was compared against the font character by character and
those two were the only misses. In other words, "the font files look fine" is not
a check; you need an explicit one.

That check is now hard-failing, on two conditions:

1. `charset.txt` differing from the current derivation exits non-zero;
2. parsing the generated `.c` and mapping the offsets in `unicode_list_1` back to
   code points using **that section's own `range_start`**, then diffing against the
   inventory, exits non-zero if anything is missing.

The second one is what actually catches the bug, because it asks "can the device
draw this character", not "is the list file fresh". The trap when implementing it:
the same file also carries an ASCII cmap with `range_start = 32`, and a regex that
matches that one first will map every offset to the wrong code point and report the
entire inventory as missing — chasing that result sends you in the wrong direction.

One last note: a shorter inventory is normal. Regenerating this time took the count
from 1303 down to 1270 — nine characters added, forty-two removed because they only
appeared in compile-time assertion messages. The three faces shrank slightly with
it, from 1.05 MB of bitmap data to 0.95 MB.
